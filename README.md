# **Heart Disease using fuzzy**
  Fuzzy logic can be used to analyse data from various sources, such as electrocardiograms and medical history, to accurately identify the presence of heart disease. In addition to traditional diagnostic methods, incorporating fuzzy logic allows for the consideration of multiple factors and their interactions in the diagnosis process. This can lead to a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of a patient's risk for heart disease. Furthermore, by integrating fuzzy logic with other diagnostic tools, such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, the overall accuracy of heart disease detection can be improved. This is particularly important for individuals who may not have obvious symptoms of heart disease but are at high risk due to other factors. By using a combination of fuzzy logic and these other diagnostic tools, healthcare professionals can better identify and treat individuals at risk for heart disease.

## **Sample Output**
*Case 2*
* Age/ years [0, 100] = 55
* Blood pressure/ mmHg [0, 220] = 150
* Cholesterol/ mmol/L [100, 250] = 189
* Sugar/ mmol/L [0, 120] = 55
* HDL/ mmol/L [0, 70] = 43
* LDL/ mmol/L [0, 190] = 122
* Risk = 4.45; low risk
